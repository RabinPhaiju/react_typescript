# Create React project with typescript

    - npx create-react-app [app_name] --template typescript

# Why TypeScript + React?

    - with static typing, you get to learn about potentail bugs as you're typing in the code, than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime.
    - Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete.
    - Makes maintenance and refractoring of large code bases much easier.

# Use type OR interfaces.

    - Use type for apps
    - Use interfaces for library
